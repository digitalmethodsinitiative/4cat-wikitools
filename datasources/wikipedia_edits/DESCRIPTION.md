This data source uses the Wikipedia API to scrape the complete edit history for a specific Wikipedia page. When 4CAT
finds an IP address instead of a user name it can use the 
[MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/ip-geolocation-databases-api-services) GeoIP database to attempt to 
geolocate the IP address. Note that IP location data may be out of date or otherwise incorrent, and is not always 
available.
